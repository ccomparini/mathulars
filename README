mathulars - some hackery to generate printable math practice
sheets for kids.

I'm putting this on github so that there's a copy someplace other
than my machine.  But, maybe you have a kid who wants some arithmetic
practice or whatever.  If so, have at it.

Update Mon Jun 24 21:56:05 UTC 2024:  added extremely simple algebra.
